# CRM-and-Sales-Pipeline

## 1. Business Goals Overview
XX Company seeks insights and evaluations from its CRM data and sales pipeline for leads registered over the last five months. The primary objectives are to **assess the sales pipeline's health**, **forecast potential income for the next six months**, and **compare sales agent performance**.

Our goal is to conduct a thorough analysis and create an interactive dashboard that enables our client to monitor salesperson performance, maintain the health of the sales pipeline, identify opportunities, enhance customer relations, make informed decisions, and optimize their strategies. 

## 2. Technical Highlights

To enhance our understanding of the dataset, we established an **SQL**  database, conducted data cleaning operations, and ultilized queries and aggregation to extract meaningful insights. We employed **subqueries, window functions, and WITH clauses** extensively to extract information in a clear and structured format.
